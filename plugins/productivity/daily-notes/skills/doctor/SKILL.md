description: Health check — verifies folder structure, profile fields, and reports which optional MCPs are currently available. Detects only; never installs or modifies MCP config
---

Run a diagnostic check against the user's notes vault and global profile. Report what's working, what's missing, and how to fix each issue.

## Hard constraint

This skill **detects** MCP availability — it never registers, installs, or modifies any MCP config. Absent MCPs are reported as "unavailable, feature X will not work" — never as an error.

## Checks

Run each check, collect results, and emit a single report at the end. Do not ask questions mid-check.

### 1. Folder structure (required)
Current working directory should be a notes vault. Verify:
- `Scratch Pad.md` exists and is readable/writable
- `Talking Points.md` exists
- `Tasks/`, `Meetings/`, `Daily Notes/` directories exist

For each missing item, record a fix: `Run /init to scaffold.` or `Create manually: touch <path>`.

### 2. Profile block (required)
Read `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Verify:
- A `## Daily Notes Plugin Profile` section exists.
- The section parses as bullet-list key/value pairs (e.g. `- display_name: Alice`).
- If `track_contacts: true`: `contacts_folder` and `recurring_meetings_label` are set.
- If `obsidian_tasks: true`: `obsidian: true` is also set (obsidian_tasks is a sub-flag).
- If `macos_notifications: true`: platform is macOS (check via `uname -s` == `Darwin`).

For each problem, record the specific field + fix.

### 3. Memory file (optional)
Check `.claude/memory.md`:
- Exists? If not, note it's optional but `/wrap-up` will create it.
- Parses? (Can be any markdown — just confirm it's not empty or binary.)

### 4. MCP availability (informational — never a hard error)

Detect which MCPs are registered in the current Claude Code session. Use whichever method works:
- Check the session's tool list for names matching `*atlassian*`, `*jira*`, `*unblocked*`, `*calendar*`, `*gcal*`, `list_events`.
- If the session exposes an MCP list (e.g. via a meta tool or env var), use it.

Report one line per integration with status `✓ available` or `✗ not configured`:
```
Atlassian MCP     ✓ available          → /jira-pull, /jira-push, /enrich-tickets, /start Jira block
Unblocked MCP     ✗ not configured     → /enrich-meeting (unavailable)
Google Calendar   ✓ available          → /calendar, /meeting-reminder, /start GCal block
```

If `gcal: true` is set in profile but Google Calendar MCP is not detected: flag this mismatch explicitly — "Profile says `gcal: true` but no Google Calendar MCP is registered in this session. Either remove `gcal: true` from your profile or add the MCP in Claude Code settings."

### 5. osascript permission (if `macos_notifications: true`)
Attempt a benign `osascript -e 'return "ok"'` call. If it errors (permission denied, not on macOS), record: "macOS Events permission needed — open System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation → grant Claude Code access to System Events." If `macos_notifications: false` or unset, skip this check entirely.

### 6. Plugin pairing
Check whether `notes-integrations` is also installed in the current Claude Code session (look for its skill names in the tool list: `recap`, `jira-pull`, etc.). Report: installed / not installed. This is informational — `daily-notes` works alone.

## Report format

Emit one of these shapes:

**All green:**
```
## Doctor — all clear ✅

Vault:        /Users/.../notes
Profile:      ok (display_name: Alice, role: manager, track_contacts: true, …)
Memory:       present
macOS events: ok

Integrations
  Atlassian       ✓ available
  Unblocked       ✗ not configured
  Google Calendar ✓ available

Plugins
  daily-notes        ✓
  notes-integrations ✓

Notes: You're fully set up. Absent integrations are optional — see /init output for how to add them.
```

**Has issues:**
```
## Doctor — 3 issues ⚠️

Critical
  1. Tasks/ directory missing at /Users/.../notes
     Fix: `mkdir -p "/Users/.../notes/Tasks"` or re-run /init

  2. Profile block missing `recurring_meetings_label` (track_contacts is true)
     Fix: Add `- recurring_meetings_label: 1:1` under ## Daily Notes Plugin Profile in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

Advisory
  3. Profile has `gcal: true` but no Google Calendar MCP detected in this session.
     Fix options:
       a) Remove `gcal: true` from profile (disables GCal skills cleanly), or
       b) Add a Google Calendar MCP in Claude Code settings (docs: ~/claude/…)

Integrations detected
  Atlassian       ✗ not configured   → Jira skills unavailable
  Unblocked       ✓ available
  Google Calendar ✗ not configured   → GCal skills unavailable
```

## Rules

- Read-only. Never write, modify, or delete any file during `/doctor`.
- Do not prompt the user during checks — run them all, report once.
- Absent MCPs are **never** errors. They become advisory issues only if the profile claims they're configured but the session disagrees (the `gcal: true` mismatch case).
- If `uname -s` is not `Darwin`, skip check 5 entirely and note: "Non-macOS detected — skipping osascript check. The `macos_notifications` feature is macOS-only."
